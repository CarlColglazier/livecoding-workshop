# livecoding-workshop

Planning materials for livecoding workshop for Computing Everywhere at Northwestern University. Originally taught in the Spring 2022 quarter.

Learning goals:

+ Familiarity with some based livecoding tools (Tidal, hydra, p5.js)
+ Introduction to livecoding culture with an emphasis on TOPLAP and Algorave culture.

## Outline

+ Introduction / demo (10 minutes)
+ Logistics (10 minutes)
+ Background lecture (30 minutes)
+ Interactive activity (45 minutes, flexible)
+ Wrap-up and next steps (15 minutes)


## Equipment

+ Computer
+ Projector and audio connection

## Introduction

See the code folder for my starting point. This will be a simple demo of music livecoding using TidalCycles on the projector.

## Logistics

(This is information specific to my role as the point-of-contact for the course / anything the instructor of record has to say)

## Background

See presentation folder ([slide contents here](./presentation/slides.md))

## Interactive

For this activity, we will use a collaborative version of p5.js: https://teddavis.org/p5live/

This runs inside your web browser, so you shouldn't need to install anything.

See the code folder.


## Wrap-up and Next Steps
